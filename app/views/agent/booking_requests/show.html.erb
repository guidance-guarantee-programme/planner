Your reference number is <%= @booking.reference %> and your appointment will
last around 45 to 60 minutes. I have sent a confirmation <%=
confirmation_type(@booking) %> which will contain all the information you need
and will help you prepare for your appointment.
</p>

<p>
To make the most of your appointment we recommend that you find out the
following:
  <ul>
    <li>how much is in your pension pot(s)</li>
    <li>an estimate of your State Pension</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="bold-large">Have you already got this information?</h3>

<p>
<strong>NO ESTIMATE OF STATE PENSION</strong> - You can check your State
Pension online at https://www.gov.uk/future-pension-centre or call the Future
Pension Centre on 0800 731 0175 to ask for a statement.

<p>
Just before you go, we have a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the
call. Would you mind completing it? It’s only 4 questions and won’t take very
long. I would really appreciate if you could leave your feedback.
</p>

<p>
If yes - great, thanks. Stay on the line and you will be transferred through.

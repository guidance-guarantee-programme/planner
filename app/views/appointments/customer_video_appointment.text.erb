Your Pension Wise video appointment link

Reference number: <%= @appointment.reference %>

Dear <%= @appointment.name %>,

This is the link to join your Pension Wise video appointment on: 

Date: <%= @appointment.proceeded_at.to_date.to_s(:govuk_date) %>
Time: <%= "#{@appointment.proceeded_at.to_s(:govuk_time)} (#{@appointment.timezone})" %>

Link to join: <%= @appointment.video_appointment_url %>

When you join the appointment, our specialist will repeat the memorable word you gave us so you know you’re speaking to Pension Wise.

We’ll wait for up to 10 minutes for you to join. After this, your appointment will need to be rescheduled as there won’t be enough time to cover everything.

Check you have the right software

Our video appointments use Microsoft Teams, so you’ll either need a device with:

* an internet browser – Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge usually work best with Teams
* the free Microsoft Teams app – you can download this from your device’s app store

Booking reference number: <%= @appointment.reference %>

Dear customer,

A third party has asked to book a Pension Wise appointment to discuss your
pension payment options. We need your authority to deliver a Pension Wise
appointment to them on your behalf.

Please complete the third party consent form and follow the return
instructions:

<%= booking_request_consent_url(@appointment.booking_request) %>

If you did not ask a third party to discuss your pension options with Pension
Wise email <%= @appointment.online_booking_reply_to %>.

Pension Wise is an impartial government service. We donâ€™t recommend any
products or tell you what to do with your money.

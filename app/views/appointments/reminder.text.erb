Preparing for your appointment

To make the most of your appointment it would be helpful if you know:

* the value of your pension pot(s) - check your pension paperwork or ask your
  provider
* an estimate of your State Pension - call the Future Pension Centre on
  0345 3000 168 for a State Pension statement
* any special arrangements attached to your pension pot, eg a guaranteed
  annuity rate or a guaranteed pot value at a certain time - ask your provider

Think about your financial circumstances in general and plans for retirement,
eg:

* sources of income like salary, benefits, savings, investments
* debts and repayments you might have
* when you want to stop working
* if you want a fixed or flexible income in retirement

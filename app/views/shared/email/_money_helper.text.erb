What’s MoneyHelper?

MoneyHelper is a government backed organisation that provides free and
impartial guidance on your money and pensions. Our service is designed to
support you in making your own informed decisions based on your circumstances.
Further information can be found at https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/about-us.

We don’t give legal or regulated financial advice or recommend specific
financial products because we aren’t regulated or authorised by the Financial
Conduct Authority to do so. This means we can’t tell you what the best option
is for you, or what to do with your money or pension. If you’re looking for
personalised money or pensions advice or specific product recommendations,
you’ll need to see a regulated financial adviser or seek legal advice.

MoneyHelper collects and stores personal data for the purpose of delivering
pensions guidance. Full details of our privacy policy, including information on
your rights in relation to the data we hold can be found at
https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/privacy. Alternatively, please write to Money
and Pensions Service, Pension Wise (MoneyHelper), Borough Hall, 138 Cauldwell
Street, Bedford, MK42 9AP.

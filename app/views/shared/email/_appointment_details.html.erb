    You’ll be sent a link to access your video appointment at least 2 days before
    your appointment time, with instructions on how to use it. Only you and our
    pensions specialist will have access to the link.

    We’ll wait for up to 10 minutes for you to join. After this, your appointment
    will need to be rescheduled as there won’t be enough time to cover everything.

Preparing for your appointment

To make the most of your appointment it would be helpful if you know:

* the value of your pension pot(s) -- check your pension paperwork or ask your provider
* an estimate of your State Pension -- call the Future Pension Centre on 0800 731 0175 for a State Pension statement
* if your pension pot contains any special features, eg a guaranteed annuity rate or a guaranteed pot value at a certain time -- ask your provider

Think about your financial circumstances in general and plans for retirement, eg:

* sources of income like salary, state benefits, savings and investments
* debts and repayments you might have
* when you want to stop working
* if you want a fixed or flexible income in retirement

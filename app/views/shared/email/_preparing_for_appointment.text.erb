Preparing for your appointment

To make the most of your appointment it would be helpful if you know:

* what type(s) of pension you have? -- ask your pension provider whether you have a defined contribution or a defined benefit pension if you are unsure
* the value of your pension pot(s) -- check your pension paperwork or ask your provider
* an estimate of your State Pension -- call the Future Pension Centre on 0800 731 0175 for a State Pension statement
* if your pension pot contains any special features, eg a guaranteed annuity rate or a guaranteed pot value at a certain time -- ask your provider

Think about your financial circumstances in general and plans for retirement, eg:

* sources of income like salary, state benefits, savings and investments
* debts and repayments you might have
* when you want to stop working
* if you want a fixed or flexible income in retirement

Coronavirus (COVID-19)

Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. If you think you might have coronavirus or you've been in close contact with someone who has it:

* stay at home and avoid close contact with other people
* do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
* use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service (https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19) to find out what to do next. The 111 coronavirus service will tell you if you need to continue to stay at home (self-isolate) or if you need medical help.
* if you've recently travelled abroad, see the coronavirus advice for travellers https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/advice-for-travellers/

How to join your video appointment

You’ll be sent a link to access your video appointment at least 2 days before
your appointment time, with instructions on how to use it. Only you and our
pensions specialist will have access to the link.

When you join the appointment, our specialist will repeat the memorable word
you gave us so you know you’re speaking to Pension Wise.

We’ll wait for up to 10 minutes for you to join. After this, your appointment
will need to be rescheduled as there won’t be enough time to cover everything.

The meeting room is large enough for one other person if you’d like someone to come with you.
